# FunDooNotesApi

This is the Fun Doo Notes Api similar to google keep.

Here I have created the backend part for user ragistration, login, forget password and reset password.

To run this repo you need to clone it and after that you need to install npm package.

Command to install npm - npm install

Above comamand will install some packages and then you can run your code with npm start command.

Here first we have Create user where user will register himself or herself.

After that you can use login part to do the login and then if you forget your passowrd.

Then you can use forget password api which will sent you a mail on your registered email id.

With the email you can use reset password.
